# Grid Snake

Snake built with CSS Grid.

## Game idea

The idea of building Snake and (over-)use CSS Grid as much as possible, started out as a practicing playground. Approaching the problem with that goal in mind, both layout and UI elements/components use CSS Grid, even where other techniques would have worked at least as well.

## Play

The UI is responsive and works on both computers and touch devices. In the latter scenario, on-screen game controls are displayed. Grid Snake can be installed as a fullscreen app (PWA). Try it out here:

## Run locally

Currently no build step is required to run locally. Serve the files in `./src` folder. Example:

- `npx http-server ./src/ -c-1`
