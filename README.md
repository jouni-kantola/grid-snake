# Grid Snake
Snake built with CSS Grid.

## Game idea
The idea of building Snake and (over-)use CSS Grid as much as possible, started out as a practicing playground. Approaching the problem with that goal in mind, both layout and UI elements/components use CSS Grid, even where other techniques would have worked at least as well.

## Play
The UI is responsive and works on both computers and touch devices. In the latter scenario, on-screen game controls are displayed. Try it out here:
